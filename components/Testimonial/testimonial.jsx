                I was 17 years old when I joined AltSchool Africa. They have the best instructors for live classes 
                and recorded lessons. Since I completed my program, I have been able to get jobs as a software engineer. 
                AltSchool Africa gave me the roadmap and the learning experience that I wouldnâ€™t have gotten at any other place.
